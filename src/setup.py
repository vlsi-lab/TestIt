# Info: This file includes the definition of the "setup" command of VerifIt. It generates a configuration .ver file if 
# it does not exist along with verifit_golden.py, which is used to define golden function(s). Both files are generated
# simply by copying the files in the templates/ directory of VerifIt, which contains fully commented examples of both
# config.ver and verifit_golden.py.
